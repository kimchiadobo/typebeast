## Tech used

* MongoDB with Mongoose
* Express

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and install the dependencies in the React server by running `npm i`. Then, install the api dependencies by running `npm install` in the typeserver directory.

## Running the app

MongoDB must be running in the background in order to start the API. You should also run the database seed script by executing `npm run seed` in the typeserver directory.

Server will run on `http://localhost:8081`

### Running the socket-server

`cd typeserver/socketserver` and `node server.js`

Server will run on `http://localhost:8080`
